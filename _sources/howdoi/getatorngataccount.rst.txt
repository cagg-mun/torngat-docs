To access torngat, a user should have applied and been granted a Compute
Canada account, then applied for an acenet account. Both of these steps
will require approval by the research project head. Once done, please
have your supervisor email cagg-systems@mun.ca, and have your full name,
and ace-net username included. Once the account has been granted access,
you will get email notification that the account is created.
